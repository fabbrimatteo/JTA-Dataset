JTA (_Joint Track Auto_) is a huge dataset for pedestrian pose estimation and tracking in urban scenarios created by exploiting the highly photorealistic video game *Grand Theft Auto V*. 
We collected a set of 512 full-HD videos (256 for training and 256 for testing), 30 seconds long, recorded at 30 fps.
The dataset was created with [this tool](https://github.com/fabbrimatteo/JTA-Mods).

## `JTA-Dataset` Contents

After the data download, your `JTA-Dataset` directory will contain the following files:

- `annotations`: directory with dataset annotations

    - `annotations/train`: directory with 256 JSON files, one for each training sequence
    - `annotations/test`: directory with 128 JSON files, one for each testing sequence
    - `annotations/val`: directory with 128 JSON files, one for each validation sequence

- `videos`: directory with dataset videos

    - `videos/train`: directory with 256 videos (.MP4), one for each training sequence

    - each frame has a size of 1920Ã—1080 _px_
    - usage example: 
        ````bash
        python to_imgs.py --out_dir_path='frames' --img_format='jpg'

## Annotations 

Each annotation file refers to a specific sequence (e.g. `seq_42.json` is the annotation file of `seq_42.mp4`). An annotation file consists of a list of lists, that is a matrix having _N_ rows and 10 columns. Each row of the matrix contains the data of a joint; these data are organized as follows:

| Element  | Name          | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `row[0]` | frame number  | number of the frame to which the joint belongs               |
| `row[1]` | person ID     | unique identifier of the person to which the joint belongs   |
| `row[2]` | joint type    | identifier of the type of joint; see 'Joint Types' subsection |
| `row[3]` | x2D           | 2D _x_ coordinate of the joint in pixel                      |
| `row[4]` | y2D           | 2D _y_ coordinate of the joint in pixel                      |
| `row[5]` | x3D           | 3D _x_ coordinate of the joint in meters                     |
| `row[6]` | y3D           | 3D _y_ coordinate of the joint in meters                     |
| `row[7]` | z3D           | 3D _z_ coordinate of the joint in meters                     |
| `row[8]` | occluded      | `1` if the joint is occluded; `0` otherwise                  |
| `row[9]` | self-occluded | `1` if the joint is occluded by its owner; `0` otherwise     |

* _Note_ #1: 2D coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the frame, while 3D coordinates are in the standard camera coordinate system.
* _Note_ #2: frames are counted starting from 1.

### Camera
Each sequence has been recorded with the same camera with the followng intrinsic matrix:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=K&space;=&space;\begin{pmatrix}&space;1158&space;&&space;0&space;&&space;960\\&space;0&space;&&space;1158&space;&&space;540\\&space;0&space;&&space;0&space;&&space;1&space;\end{pmatrix}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K&space;=&space;\begin{pmatrix}&space;1158&space;&&space;0&space;&&space;960\\&space;0&space;&&space;1158&space;&&space;540\\&space;0&space;&&space;0&space;&&space;1&space;\end{pmatrix}" title="K = \begin{pmatrix} 1158 & 0 & 960\\ 0 & 1158 & 540\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}" /></a>

### Joint Types

The associations between numerical identifier and type of joint are the following:

```
 0: head_top
 1: head_center
 2: neck
 3: right_clavicle
 4: right_shoulder
 5: right_elbow
 6: right_wrist
 7: left_clavicle
 8: left_shoulder
 9: left_elbow
10: left_wrist
11: spine0
12: spine1
13: spine2
14: spine3
15: spine4
16: right_hip
17: right_knee
18: right_ankle
19: left_hip
20: left_knee
21: left_ankle
```

### Annotation Management - Example

- Read data of an annotation file and convert it to numpy array:

  ```python
  import json
  import numpy as np

  json_file_path = 'annotations/training/seq_42.json'

  with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
      matrix = json.load(json_file)
      matrix = np.array(matrix)
  ```

- Get data of frame #118:

  ```python
  frame_data = matrix[matrix[:, 0] == 118]
  ```

- Get data of all the joints of person with ID=3 in frame #118:

  ```python
  person_data = frame_data[frame_data[:, 1] == 3]
  ```

- _Note_: we have chosen to save our annotations in JSON format for portability reasons. However, if you want to speed up data loading in Python, we suggest converting the annotations to numpy format:
  ```ptyhon
  np.save(json_file_path.replace('json', 'npy'), matrix)
  ```
  
### COCO-Style Annotations 

If you want, you can convert our annotations to [COCO format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data) using the `coco_style_convert.py` script, but note that occlusion, tracking and 3D informations are not available in that format. 

## Important Note

This dataset was introduced in the paper "Learning to Detect and Track Visible and Occluded Body Joints in a Virtual World" (ECCV 2018). In the experimental section of the paper, when referring to the "test set", we mean the set consisting of the `test` and `val` directories of the JTA Dataset.
